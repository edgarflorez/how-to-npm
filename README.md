## FINALE
Final notes from the ***workshop***.

    # There is SO MUCH MORE that npm can do.  Some of the things that we didn't
    # have time to cover in this modest little workshop include:
    # 
    # 1. Splitting your app up into multiple modules
    # 2. Sharing private code with teammates using scoped modules
    # 3. Other fun npm commands, like `edit` and `bugs` and `explore`!
    # 
    # You can still learn more about all the fun you and npm can have together.
    # It all starts with the thought: "There should be a module that does this..."
    # 
    # Your adventure is awaiting you at https://www.npmjs.com/
    # 
    # See you on the internet!

## NOTES
> This workshop lives in their own rep because it could break and complicate the *nodeschool* repo.
